The beginning of this journey starts on 1/8/2018 when I was hired as a Animal Control Community Services Officer.

This was a dream job for me, loved every day of it. The aspect of saving animals, or making their situations more happy and comfortable. After 6 months, I became a level two Officer being able to conduct criminal investigations and serve citations for violations that involved the domestic animal. Another 6 months later I became a level three Officer and was commissioned as a state agent for the Bureau of Animal Protection.

At this point many of my investigations were class 6 felony charges of state level animal cruelty and dangerous animals attacking kids and families! Which I'm sure you can imagine the cases were detrimental to see in person. I saw the worst of the worse, and had to make very hard decisions. These decisions and certain situations have changed my life.

I felt through certain emotions and breakdowns, but my life is forever changed because of this career choise. That is why I am taking a different path to a life of enjoyment and my other passion, computers and software being combined with imagination to make incredible creations for others to enjoy. The stress of these life altering situations are behind me and looking forward to bettering the enjoyment of life.

I'm Steven, and thank you for reading!
